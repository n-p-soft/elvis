Elvis
=====

This is my version of Elvis 2.2 (by Steve Kirkendall, 2003), which is a
clone of the Vim editor. Elvis 2.2 is distributed under the terms of the
"Clarified Artistic License" (see file COPYING).

32-bit/64-bit Linux and BSD are the only operating systems supported here.

To compile the editor, first run "./configure" and then "make". To install
the result, use "make install" (optional DESTDIR=...) as root.
